# Customer Support / Success   
|                              Agent / Automation (Gap) |                                                                           What it Does |                                               KPIs it Improves |                                               Why SMBs Need It / Why It’s Missing |
|:------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|                      **Smart Triage & Intent Router** |       Auto-detect intent, priority, sentiment; routes to best queue/agent with context | First Response Time (FRT), Avg Handle Time (AHT), SLA hit rate |  SMBs juggle multiple inboxes; enterprise triage exists but is costly and complex |
|                **Auto-Reply + Knowledge Synthesizer** |                 Drafts high-quality replies from KB, tickets, contracts; cites sources |                                     FRT, CSAT, Resolution Time |     Most “AI macros” are generic; source-grounded answers are enterprise features |
|                       **Proactive Incident Detector** |            Correlates spikes (tickets, status page, social) → posts RCA draft + macros |            Ticket Volume/incident, MTTR, CSAT during incidents |         True cross-signal correlation tooling is pricey and hard to wire for SMBs |
|                       **Customer Journey Risk Radar** |                Predicts churn from product usage drops, billing events, NPS, sentiment |                Churn %, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), Save Rate |    Predictive models require data plumbing; SMB suites don’t bundle it affordably |
|                      **Auto-Deflection Orchestrator** |                 Chooses best deflection (FAQ, guided flow, video, form) per query type |                                 Self-Serve %, Cost/Ticket, AHT |                  Most portals are static; ML-driven deflection is enterprise-tier |
|                           **Multimodal KB Generator** |          Converts solved tickets into articles, step flows, short videos; auto-updates |                         Article Coverage %, Self-Serve %, CSAT |            Continuous KB upkeep is hard; automated, multi-format creation is rare |
|                      **Contract & Entitlement Guard** |            Reads plans/SLAs; enforces response/priority and entitlements automatically |                      SLA Compliance, VIP CSAT, Escalation Rate |                                 Entitlement logic usually locked in high-end CRMs |
|                        **Outbound Success Playbooks** | Triggers success motions from product signals (onboarding stalls, feature not adopted) |                Time-to-Value (TTV), Adoption %, Expansion Rate |                            “Success-led growth” tooling is fragmented & expensive |
|                               **QoS / Quality Coach** |       Scores tickets for tone, clarity, policy; suggests next best action and training |                                   QA Scores, Reopen Rate, CSAT |                   QA at scale is manual or vendor-led; AI QA is enterprise add-on |
|                             **Refund/Appeal Arbiter** |            Policy engine + LLM summary → approves/denies with rationale + alternatives |                Refund Cost, CSAT After Denial, Chargeback Rate |                            Risky to build; vendors price it high due to liability |
| **Multichannel Unifier (Email/Chat/Social/WhatsApp)** |                               One queue with dedupe & identity merge; unified timeline |                                    FCR, AHT, Agent Utilization |                          True omni-channel unification is locked to premium plans |
|               **Success Forecast & Capacity Planner** |                      Predicts ticket load & CSM bandwidth; suggests hiring/outsourcing |                                Backlog, SLA %, Agent Occupancy |                              Forecasting tools are RevOps-focused, not CS-focused |
|                  **In-Product Guided Troubleshooter** |                     Dynamic decision trees embedded in app; logs telemetry and outcome |                              Self-Serve %, FCR, Bug Repro Time |             Builders exist, but telemetry-aware troubleshooters are rare for SMBs |
|                    **Revenue-Safe Escalation Matrix** |                      Scores account value/risk; auto-escalates to senior agents or AMs |                             Save Rate, NRR, Time-to-Escalation |                             Tightly coupled CS × Sales handoff is bespoke in SMBs |
