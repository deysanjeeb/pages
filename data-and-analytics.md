|                   **Agent / Automation (Gap)** |                                                                                                                                    **What It Does** |                                                 **KPIs It Improves** |                                              **Why Companies Need It / Selling Points** |                                                                                **Why It’s Missing or Expensive for SMBs** |
|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|           **Data Pipeline Orchestrator Agent** |             Automatically connects SaaS tools (CRM, payment, HR, marketing, support) → builds unified data tables & refresh schedules without code. |            Data Freshness %, Report Accuracy, Manual Reporting Hours |                 Gives SMBs an automated “data backbone” without hiring a data engineer. |                                 Tools like Fivetran, Airbyte, dbt Cloud are enterprise-priced or require setup expertise. |
|     **LLM Data Query Agent (“Ask Your Data”)** |           Allows natural-language questions like “What’s our MRR trend?” or “Which campaigns had best ROI?” by querying internal DBs automatically. |                 Decision Latency, Exec Report Time, BI Adoption Rate |    Reduces dependency on analysts; leadership can self-serve insights in plain English. |            Enterprise BI assistants (e.g., ThoughtSpot Sage, PowerBI Copilot) are costly or require Microsoft ecosystems. |
|     **Data Quality & Anomaly Detection Agent** |                            Scans all data tables for missing, duplicated, or unusual values (e.g., revenue spike, zero leads) and alerts the owner. |             Data Accuracy %, Time to Detect Errors, Data Trust Score |       Prevents “bad decisions from bad data” — maintains trust in analytics dashboards. |                                 Enterprise data observability tools (Monte Carlo, Bigeye, Soda) start at thousands/month. |
|               **Auto-Dashboard Builder Agent** |              Generates and updates dashboards dynamically when new data sources are connected. Suggests relevant metrics and visuals automatically. |          Dashboard Coverage %, Time to Insight, Report Adoption Rate |                   SMB owners get immediate visibility into performance with zero setup. |                                             BI tools like Looker/Tableau require schema setup, modeling, and design time. |
|               **Predictive Insight Generator** |      Uses regression and time-series models to predict churn, sales, or expenses automatically and produces natural-language “next-step” summaries. |                     Forecast Accuracy, Churn %, Sales Predictability |                      Gives SMBs “enterprise-grade forecasting” without data scientists. |                         Predictive modules in enterprise BI suites (SAP, Oracle, PowerBI Pro) are costly and data-hungry. |
|                     **KPI Goal Tracker Agent** |                              Centralizes key metrics across departments, tracks them against OKRs, and auto-notifies teams if metrics go off track. | Goal Achievement %, Response Time to KPI Change, Accountability Rate |            Keeps teams aligned to goals without manual tracking; great for remote SMBs. | Advanced KPI tracking requires integrations + automation logic; existing tools (Lattice, WorkBoard) are enterprise-level. |
|         **Data Governance / Compliance Agent** |        Monitors PII usage, auto-classifies sensitive data, and ensures compliance (GDPR, SOC2, etc.) without requiring a dedicated compliance team. |         Data Risk Exposure, Audit Finding Rate, Compliance Adherence |                   Protects SMBs from fines and builds trust; automates legal readiness. |                                           Compliance automation tools (BigID, OneTrust) are priced for mid-market+ firms. |
|            **Customer 360 Intelligence Agent** |                                Unifies customer data across CRM, billing, support, and product logs → provides full journey summaries per customer. |                                        Retention %, NPS, Upsell Rate |            Gives teams a complete view of each customer for better upsells and support. |                             True 360 solutions (Salesforce Genie, Segment CDP) are too expensive and complex to maintain. |
|                **Auto-Narrative Report Agent** |                                                Converts raw metrics into executive summaries (weekly/monthly reports) in natural language + charts. |            Exec Reporting Time, Read Rate of Reports, Decision Speed |                SMB execs get automated insights instead of dashboards they never check. |                     Enterprise BI products like Narrative Science or PowerBI Copilot offer this but cost thousands/month. |
|        **Cost & Profitability Analysis Agent** |                                   Consolidates transaction, payroll, and ops data to reveal per-client or per-project profit margins automatically. |            Gross Margin %, Cost per Customer, Operational Efficiency |              Gives SMBs a CFO-level insight into which clients/projects are profitable. |                       Requires integrated accounting + ops data; existing “ERP lite” tools don’t combine both affordably. |

|                           **Agent** |                                                 **Why It’s a Killer SMB Product** |                           **Core Stack Suggestion** |
