# Operations / Administration   
|                          Agent / Automation (Gap) |                                                                                                                                                                                                                What it Does |                                                                           KPIs it Improves |                                                                                                                 Why SMBs Especially Need It (and Why It’s Missing) |
|:--------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|    **Workload-Balancer & Capacity Planner Agent** |                                                                      Monitors team workload, project tasks, employee time logs, and automatically assigns or rebalances tasks across teams to avoid bottlenecks or burnout. |       Utilization Rate, On-Time Task Completion %, Overtime Hours, Project Delivery Delays |  SMBs often rely on manual task-assignments and under-visibility into capacity. Fully automated capacity planning tools tend to be enterprise-grade and expensive. |
|            **Purchase/Vendor Approval Automator** |                                       Automatically routes purchase requests (office supplies, vendor services) through policy checks, budget constraints, vendor scorecards, then approves or rejects or flags exceptions. |                Spend Compliance %, Purchase Cycle Time, Vendor Lead Time, Maverick Spend % | Many SMBs still handle these manually (emails, spreadsheets). Commercial tools that integrate budget policy + vendor score + workflow are priced for larger firms. |
|  **Facility & Asset Maintenance Scheduler Agent** |                                       Tracks office assets (computers, printers, furniture), schedules periodic maintenance or replacement, logs usage/life-cycle, triggers procurement when end-of-life or under-utilised. |    Asset Utilization %, Maintenance Cost per Asset, Downtime Hours, Replacement Efficiency |                                                                SMBs often don’t have formal asset-lifecycle systems; tools exist but cost is high and setup heavy. |
|     **Document & Policy Lifecycle Manager Agent** |                                   Keeps track of administrative documents (leases, insurance, contracts, vendor agreements), triggers reminders for renewals, audits versions, ensures latest version is in shared library. | Renewal Timeliness %, Contract Expiry Alerts, Compliance Incidents, Version-Control Errors |                                                         Many SMBs use ad hoc spreadsheets; enterprise DMS/policy lifecycle tools are expensive and often overkill. |
|      **Cross-System Workflow Orchestrator Agent** | Connects disparate systems (HRIS, CRM, ERP, Admin tools), automates multi-system workflows (e.g., new hire triggers asset request + account creation + onboarding schedule + budget reallocation) without manual hand-offs. |      Workflow Lead Time, Hand-off Errors %, Cost per Onboarding, Time to Full Productivity |                       SMBs frequently have disconnected tools and manual process glue. Integration/orchestration platforms are pricey and require technical staff. |
|   **Admin Analytics & Bottleneck Detector Agent** |                               Monitors internal process metrics (e.g., invoice approvals, procurement cycles, facility requests) and uses anomaly/pattern detection to highlight bottlenecks, inefficiencies or cost-leaks. | Cycle Time for Admin Processes, Cost per Request, Request Backlog, Admin Cost % of Revenue |                Analytics for operations admin often gets ignored in SMBs; enterprise solutions focus on manufacturing or heavy supply chain—not light admin flows. |
| **Compliance & Risk-Trigger Agent for Admin Ops** |       Monitors administrative triggers (contract expiries, insurance renewals, regulatory filings, vendor audit schedules), auto-generates tasks or notifications, tracks remediation; possibly uses LLM to summarise risk. |     Compliance Incident Rate, Audit Finding Count, Admin Remediation Time, Risk Exposure % |                                                         SMBs may not have dedicated risk/compliance teams; tools exist only in high-reg sectors or at large scale. |
